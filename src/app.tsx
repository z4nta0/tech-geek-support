/**
 * AppRooCom = App Root Component
 *
 * @summary
 * The top of the component tree: renders the bar, the page the address
 * matches inside the main landmark, and the footer, so every page shares the
 * same frame. The routes take the current location and use its path as their
 * key, so moving to another page replaces the old page's tree rather than
 * updating it, which restarts the new page's entrance animation. It calls
 * useScrTopFun so every link opens its page at the top, as a real page load
 * would, while back and forward keep the browser's restored position.
 *
 * @author z4nta0 <https://github.com/z4nta0>
 *
 * @param props - This component does not use any props.
 *
 * @returns A fragment holding the bar, the main landmark, and the footer.
