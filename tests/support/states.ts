 * states.ts = States
 *
 * @summary
 * The page states the accessibility, interaction, and rendering suites visit,
 * and the helper that opens one; the responsive suite opens its own widths
 * through the same helper. A state is a page at a width, sometimes with
 * something opened on it: every route and the 404 page at phone and desktop
 * widths, and the mobile menu open on a phone. opeStaFun sizes the viewport,
 * loads the page, waits for the fonts, scrolls through the page so any lazily
 * loaded image loads, runs the state's own action, such as opening the menu,
 * and then waits for the page to stay still so nothing is measured mid-fade.
